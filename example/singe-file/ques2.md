QUEST 2 is non-stop fun. The biggest titles and multi-player games—we have them. New ways to workout, socialize or lose track of time—we have those too. And our library keeps growing every day. Discover what’s possible on QUEST 2.


Think QUEST 2 is just for gaming? You’d be mistaken. QUEST 2 makes it possible to sit front row at a live concert, burn calories atop a glacier, hang out with friends all over the world, work, watch a movie and yes, even play a game.


From multiplayer games to unique social experiences to joining up with friends at a live show or instructor-led workout, opportunities to meet and connect with others in VR are virtually everywhere you look.


No wires means you're not stuck playing QUEST 2 at home. You’re free to take all the games, workouts, shows, experiences and more on the road with you. Which means you can go anywhere with it, and do anything in it.
